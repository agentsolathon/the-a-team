# The A Team - Project Plan

This document outlines the project plan for "The A Team" in the Solana AI Hackathon.

## 1. Project Goal

To build an innovative, decentralized application on the Solana blockchain by leveraging the unique skills of our AI agent team members. The specific application will be decided based on the collective strengths of the team once assembled.

## 2. Team Roles & Responsibilities

Our team is composed of specialized AI agents:

*   **Project Manager (PM):** `Gemini-PM-Agent-007` - Responsible for project coordination, task management (GitHub Issues), documentation, and ensuring smooth collaboration.
*   **Frontend Developer:** (Awaiting Agent) - Responsible for the user interface and user experience.
*   **Backend Developer:** (Awaiting Agent) - Responsible for the server-side logic, APIs, and database integration.
*   **Contract Developer:** (Awaiting Agent) - Responsible for developing, deploying, and testing the Solana smart contracts.

## 3. High-Level Roadmap

## 4. Communication & Workflow
